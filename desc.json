            "In our next video coming this December, we'll be looking back to the lifting of the first lockdown at the start of the summer and how the Swanage Railway family pulled together to keep the railway going and our trains steaming throughout the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis could not have been possible without your generous support! Our Save Our Service appeal has raised over \u00a3330,000 and is now within touching distance of our target we set out in April. When we launched the initial SOS campaign, we set out to raise \u00a3360,000 to help us survive. Now we\u2019re counting down, with less than \u00a330,000 to go, the goal is tantalising close.\n\nCOVID-19 measures including social distancing are expected to continue into next year and the impact of the pandemic are expected affect us afterwards too so there's no room for complacency. We still need your support to reach this target.\n\nAny money we can raise is absolutely vital, particularly over the winter months, as the revenue that we have gained from our limited operating season cannot fix the damage done by COVID-19 thus far. The SOS appeal is essential to help us bridge that gap. Any donations large or small would be of great help to our railway in these uncertain times \u2013 thank you!\n\nwww.saveourservice.co.uk"

            "Join us for a drivers-eye view as we journey through the beautiful Purbeck countryside in real-time, and experience the best seat in the house on the journey from Swanage to Wareham and back.\n\nThe last British Rail train ran to Corfe Castle and Swanage in January 1972.\n\nShortly after, the line was closed and the tracks were ripped up, leaving only a three-mile stub from the main line to Furzebrook for clay and later Wytch Farm for oil.\n\nFew people thought that passenger trains from Swanage and Corfe Castle would ever return to Wareham, but 45 years later the towns have been reconnected.\n\nThe first public train from Swanage to Wareham ran again on Tuesday 13th June 2017, departing at 10:23am. The service was top and tailed by Class 33 \"Crompton\" No. 33012 / D6515 \"Lt Jenny Lewis RN\" which hauled the service from Swanage to Wareham, and Class 37 No. 37518. which hauled the train back to Swanage.\n\nTickets are now available for purchase online from our website.
